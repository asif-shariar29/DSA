# 📚 DSA & DAA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** and **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** code archive!

This repository contains **some problems** that I solved during my **initial learning stage of DSA & DAA** in my **2nd year journey as a CSE student**. I'm uploading these here mainly for **storage, backup**, and to **organize my work** for easier future reference.

The report includes:
- ✅ Brief theory and algorithm for each problem  
- ✅ Code screenshots  
- ✅ Input/output screenshots  
- ✅ Graphs and diagrams created using online tools/websites  
- ✅ Sample input styles used during testing
